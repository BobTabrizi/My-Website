About a month ago I've been looking into rebuilding my site, to make it look better and also feel better to use. I was curious if I should try out another framework from the current one I used which was NextJS. As someone who works daily in both front and back end environments, I am a big fan of NextJS but I have been constantly hearing about a new framework called Astro.

Astro that is specifically built for SSG, which is exactly what I need for a personal site. NextJS can also handle SSG quite well, but what brought Astro to my attention was the relatively new concept of _partial hydration_. Because my personal site is mostly static content, minimizing javascript is a massive win in the performance department. I went ahead and started looking into the world of Astro.

## Getting Started With Astro

I went through some tutorials and briefly ran through the basics in the documentation. A very neat feature Astro has is prebuilt themes for sites. Anyone can create one and submit a theme for everyone to use. Since I'm just beginning to pick up Astro, I decided to pick up a theme and tinker around with it. I ended up going with the [AstroWind](https://astrowind.vercel.app/) theme.

I'll be sharing what my experiences are in the next post. Stay tuned.
